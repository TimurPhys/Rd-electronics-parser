# RD Electronics Parser

This project is quite simple, it allows you to **structure** and **store data** from your web requests on certain products.

You can enter name of the product you are interested, then select a category and parser
will create a **json file** with all the products it has found.
After that you are also suggested to store all the data in **Excel table**.

In folder example you can find an example of parser's work

_**Enjoy!**_
